# LG-Membership-Page

Project designed and developed during my Summer Internship at LG. 

The LG Customer Membership Page project successfully achieved its objective of integrating web development with a database tool. The skills gained during the internship, including proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB Atlas, and the installation of nodemon in VS Code, greatly contributed to the project's success. The collaborative effort and the inclusion of additional functionalities showcased the ability to deliver an efficient and user-friendly interface. This project served as a testament to the intern's dedication, problem-solving skills, and adaptability to modern web development technologies.
